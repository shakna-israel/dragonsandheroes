# Dragons & Heroes

A simple console-based game in the flavour of [ProgressQuest](http://progressquest.com/).

I built it in the space of 2 nights, enjoy.

```
git clone https://github.com/shakna-israel/dragonsandheroes.git
cd dragonsandheroes
python selfPlayer.py
```

# Goals:

- [X] Backwards compatibility (Any new features should fit in seamlessly.)
- [ ] Complete [TODO](TODO.md)
- [ ] Maybe optionally collect stats onto a GitHub Page, for some sort of high-score table?
- [ ] Release to PyPI (Reorganise repository so it is easier to manage, and not so crazy-looking)
- [ ] Multiple save files? (At least store the save file in a particular location)
- [X] 0 dependencies.
